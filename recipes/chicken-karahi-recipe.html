    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In the context of the curry, a Chicken Karahi is a tomato and ginger based, thick masala curry which is though to
        originate from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. The original, authentic method of making it is a very specific
        one. As a general rule, Karahis are made from a base of ginger, garlic and tomatoes and also contain fresh green
        chillis, julienne-cut raw ginger and coriander. It’s a rather thick, jammy gravy and concentrated in flavour –
        yum!</p>
    <p><strong>The traditional Karahi has undergone pretty major alterations over time. </strong>In order to bulk up the
        masala gravy and also cut the cost, onions have been added in so frequently in restaurants that many people know
        don’t even know the real recipe doesn’t contain onion. I’ve also seen variations use large chunks of red onion
        and capsicum much like a Chicken Jalfrezi. Modern day conveniences such as tinned tomatoes and pre-packaged jars
        of ginger and garlic are also pretty normal too.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded, cut into 12 pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ginger and garlic paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red chile powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>6 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 green chile peppers, finely chopped, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or karahi over high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook until starting to brown, about
            5 minutes. Add water, cumin, salt, ginger and garlic paste, red chile powder, and turmeric; cook and stir
            until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir tomatoes and green chile peppers into the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken pieces
            are no longer pink at the bone, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should
            read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cilantro leaves over chicken and cook until leaves look slightly wilted, about 30 seconds.</li>
    </ol>
