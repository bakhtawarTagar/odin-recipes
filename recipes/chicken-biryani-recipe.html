    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Biryani is an intricate rice dish made with layers of curried meat and rice. Given its use of adornments and
        luxurious finishes, it’s no surprise that biryani has roots in Persian cuisine.</p>
    <p>In Pakistan, pakki (or cooked) biryani is most common, with several prominent varieties such as Sindhi,
        Karachi-style, and Bombay biryani. This recipe is an amalgamation of these styles and is similar to what you’d
        find at a typical Pakistani or Indian restaurant or dinner party.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium dried bay leaves, (tez patta)</li>
        <li>5-6 whole cloves, (loung)</li>
        <li>4-5 whole black cardamoms, (badi elaichi)</li>
        <li>6 star anise, (badiyaan)</li>
        <li>6 green cardamom pods, (elaichi)</li>
        <li>2 3-inch cinnamon sticks, (daarchini)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp cumin seeds, (zeera)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns, (kaali mirch)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the ingredients listed under ‘marinade’. Cover and set aside or
            refrigerate (ideally) up to overnight. When ready to use, allow the chicken to come to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Thoroughly wash the rice and soak it in water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy bottomed pan over high heat. Add the oil, ghee, and onions and sauté until the onions
            are golden (~15-20 minutes). Deglaze the pan with ¼ cup water. Once the water dries up, add the whole
            spices, garlic, and ginger and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken with its marinade and sauté until it changes color (~2-3 minutes). Add the tomatoes, green
            chili pepper, and dried plum (alu bukhara) and stir to coat. Add ½ cup water (the water should cover about
            1/3 of the chicken) and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to a gentle simmer (this is low heat on my stovetop), cover, and allow the chicken to
            cook for 30 minutes, stirring midway. While the chicken is cooking, proceed to the next step. Turn off the
            heat once the chicken has cooked.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Place a medium pot over high heat and bring 7 cups (1.75 quarts) of water to a
            boil (See Tip). Add salt, oil, and lemon juice/vinegar and stir. Once the water comes to a boil, drain and
            add the rice. Stir, and bring it back up to a boil. Once it comes to a boil again, boil for 5 minutes (no
            more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds), or until the rice is just cooked with a bite to it. It shouldn’t get
            mushy when pressed between your fingers. (See Note 1) Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Uncover the chicken. Raise the heat to medium-high to sauté out any excess water for 2-3 minutes. Add salt,
            garam masala, and red chili flakes for more heat (if desired). The oil will have separated from the
            ‘masala’. Turn off the heat. Add kewra water and lemon juice and stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>
